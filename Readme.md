# Kmeans and KNN
In this repo Kmeans is used to find out the optimum number of clusters
through the elbow analysis. With this in mind, the dataset is labeled accordinly in two groups. This dataset is used to train a KNN classifier. Artificial data is then generated in the kmeans.py script. This data is later used in KNN classifier to predict labels and compare them with the labels Kmeans would give to the dataset
